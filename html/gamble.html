        -A multiplier starts increasing, and players must decide when to cash out to secure their winnings.
        If they cash out in time, they win the corresponding multiple of their bet. However, 
        if they fail to cash out before the crash, they lose their bet. 



        -minigame 2 mines
        - where players try to uncover as many mines as possible without triggering an explosion.
         Players choose a grid of cells to reveal, and each cell may either contain a mine or be safe.
          The goal is to uncover as many safe cells as possible without hitting a mine. 
          The more safe cells uncovered, the higher the payout. However, 
          if a mine is revealed, the game ends, and the player loses their bet
